This is a reimplementation of the incredibly useful unix tools, and i know
there is no point in reinventing the wheel, but practice makes perfection
so i'm practicing. All the tools are licensed under the GNU license.

The compilation of the tools is pretty easy, you can just type  ```make all```
inside the `unix_tools` project folder or a specific tool folder and then
automation will take care of everything for you


The code quality is not good and i'm implementing the tools very slowly because
this is more of a "i have nothing to do" project, so i don't recommend using any 
of the tools here for anything as their quality is very low and they are not 
portable
